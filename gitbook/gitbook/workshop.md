# Introduction

## Kubernetes and Banking

You may be wondering how Kubernetes and banking fit together - let's start with some basics.

Kubernetes is a container orchestrator to provision, manage, and scale applications. In other words, Kubernetes allows you to manage the lifecycle of containerized applications within a cluster of nodes \(which are a collection of worker machines, for example, VMs, physical machines etc.\).

Kubernetes minimizes outages and disruptions through self-healing, intelligent scheduling, horizontal scaling, and load balancing. Developers can easily roll out and roll back application versions, whether theyâ€™re collaborating in development and test environments or deploying to production. Even new application functionality is streamlined, when developers extend apps with cloud services. The Result: Spend more time coding and less time with the infrastructure.

Today we will see why Kubernetes and microservices are a perfect fit for financial institutions. We will see how the financial world once was, what microservice and Kubernetes offer, and finally we'll see what IBM has been doing with the Open Banking Platform.
