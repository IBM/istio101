# Exercise 7 - Secure your services

## Mutual authentication with Transport Layer Security (mTLS)

Istio can secure the communication between microservices without requiring application code changes. Security is provided by authenticating and encrypting communication paths within the cluster. This is becoming a common security and compliance requirement. Delegating communication security to Istio (as opposed to implementing TLS in each microservice), ensures that your application will be deployed with consistent and manageable security policies.

Istio Citadel is an optional part of Istio's control plane components. When enabled, it provides each Envoy sidecar proxy with a strong (cryptographic) identity, in the form of a certificate.
Identity is based on the microservice's service account and is independent of its specific network location, such as cluster or current IP address.
Envoys then use the certificates to identify each other and establish an authenticated and encrypted communication channel between them.

Citadel is responsible for:

* Providing each service with an identity representing its role.

* Providing a common trust root to allow Envoys to validate and authenticate each other.

* Providing a key management system, automating generation, distribution, and rotation of certificates and keys.

When an application microservice connects to another microservice, the communication is redirected through the client side and server side Envoys. The end-to-end communication path is:

* Local TCP connection (i.e., `localhost`, not reaching the "wire") between the application and Envoy (client- and server-side);

* Mutually authenticated and encrypted connection between Envoy proxies.

When Envoy proxies establish a connection, they exchange and validate certificates to confirm that each is indeed connected to a valid and expected peer. The established identities can later be used as basis for policy checks (e.g., access authorization).

## Steps

> Version 2 of the guestbook application uses an external service (tone analyzer) which is not Istio-enabled. Current Istio release (0.8) has a [known limitation](https://istio.io/help/faq/security.html#istio-to-not-istio), where where an mTLS enabled service fails to communicate with a service without Istio. This limitation will be lifted in an upcoming release.
> Thus, we will disable mTLS globally and enable it only for communication between internal cluster services in this lab.

1. Ensure Citadel is running

Citadel is Istio's in-cluster Certificate Authority (CA) and is required for generating and managing cryptographic identities in the cluster.
Verify Citadel is running:

```shell
kubectl get deployment -l istio=citadel -n istio-system
```

Expected output:

```shell
NAME            DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
istio-citadel   1         1         1            1           15h
```

1. Define mTLS Authentication Policy

Define mTLS authentication policy for the analyzer service:

```shell
cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: authentication.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: Policy
metadata:
  name: mtls-to-analyzer
  namespace: default
spec:
  targets:
  - name: analyzer
  peers:
  - mtls:
EOF
Created config policy/default/mtls-to-analyzer at revision 3934195
```

Confirm the policy has been created:

```shell
kubectl get policies.authentication.istio.io
NAME              AGE
mtls-to-analyzer  1m
```

3. Enable mTLS from guestbook using a Destination rule

```shell
cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: route-with-mtls-for-analyzer
  namespace: default
spec:
  host: "analyzer.default.svc.cluster.local"
  trafficPolicy:
    tls:
      mode: ISTIO_MUTUAL
EOF
Created config destination-rule/default/route-with-mtls-for-analyzer at revision 3934279
```

## Verifying the Authenticated Connection

If mTLS is working correctly, the Guestbook app should continue to operate as expected, without any user visible impact. Istio will automatically add (and manage) the required certificates and private keys. To confirm their presence in the Envoy containers, do the following:

1. Get the name of a guestbook pod. Make sure the pod is “Running”.

```shell
kubectl get pods -l app=guestbook
NAME                            READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
guestbook-v2-784546fbb9-299jz   2/2       Running   0          13h
guestbook-v2-784546fbb9-hsbnq   2/2       Running   0          13h
guestbook-v2-784546fbb9-lcxdz   2/2       Running   0          13h
```

2. SSH into the Envoy container. Make sure to change the pod name into the corresponding one on your system. This command will execute into istio-proxy container (sidecar) of the pod.

```shell
kubectl exec -it guestbook-v2-xxxxxxxx -c istio-proxy /bin/bash
```

3. Verify that the certificate and keys are present.

```shell
ls /etc/certs/
```

You should see the following (plus some others):

```shell
cert-chain.pem   key.pem   root-cert.pem
```

Note that `cert-chain.pem` is Envoy’s public certificate (i.e., presented to the peer), and `key.pem` is the corresponding private key. The `root-cert.pem` file is Citadel's root certificate, used to verify peer certificates.

## Quiz

**True or False?**

1. Istio Citadel provides each microservice with a strong, cryptographic, identity in the form of a certificate. The certificates' life cycle is fully managed by Istio. (True)

2. Istio provides microservices with mutually authenticated connections, without requiring app code changes. (True)

3. Mutual authentication must be on or off for the entire cluster, gradual adoption is not possible. (False)
