# Introduction to Istio

Getting to know Istio Meetup content

## Setup
- Follow the prerequisites in [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md)
- Use the [setup script](./scripts/setup.sh) when you are ready to prepare your kubernetes cluster

## Demos

The [DEMO](./DEMO.md) contains a walkthrough of each demo and what script to run.
<b>All demo scripts should be run within the manifests directory.</b>

- Each demo script will halt for a user to press a button when further explanation is needed before continuing.
- Files will be presented to the screen after the command runs so that the presenter can review
what was just created while Istio is setting routes.
- Each demo has it's own unique script that will cleanup everything created as the final step.
